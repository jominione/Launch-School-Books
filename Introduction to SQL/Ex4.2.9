-- Build on the query from the previous question to return the name of any 
-- customer who ordered fries. Return this in a column called 'Customers who 
-- like Fries'. Don't repeat the same customer name more than once in the 
-- results.

-- Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_name AS 'Customers who like Fries'
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items AS oi
ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products AS p
ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.product_name = 'Fries';
