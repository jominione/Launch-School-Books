-- Change the name of the celebrities table to singers, and remove anyone 
-- who isn't a singer.

-- Hint: There is a NOT LIKE operator which works in the same way as the LIKE 
-- operator except it matches rows where the search string is not present 
-- in the overall string.

-- Solution:

ALTER TABLE celebrities 
RENAME TO singers;

DELETE FROM singer
WHERE occupation 
NOT LIKE '%Singer%';
