-- To associate customers with products, we need to do two more things:

-- 1. Alter or replace the orders table so that we can associate a customer 
      with one or more orders (we also want to record an order status in this 
      table).
-- 2. Create an order_items table so that an order can have one or more 
      products associated with it.

-- Based on the order descriptions below, amend and create the tables as 
-- necessary and populate them with the appropriate data.

-- James has one order, consisting of a Chicken Burger, Fries, Onion Rings, 
-- and a Lemonade. It has a status of 'In Progress'.

-- Natasha has two orders. The first consists of a Cheeseburger, Fries, and 
-- a Cola, and has a status of 'Placed'; the second consists of a Double Deluxe 
-- Burger, a Cheeseburger, two sets of Fries, Onion Rings, a Chocolate Shake 
-- and a Vanilla Shake, and has a status of 'Complete'.

-- Aaron has one order, consisting of an LS Burger and Fries. It has a status 
-- of 'Placed'.

-- Assume that the order_status field of the orders table can hold strings 
-- of up to 20 characters.
