-- We want to create an albums table to hold all the above data except the 
-- singer name, and create a reference from the albums table to the singers 
-- table to link each album to the correct singer. Write the necessary SQL 
-- statements to do this and to populate the table with data. Assume Album 
-- Name, Genre, and Label can hold strings up to 100 characters. Include an 
-- auto-incrementing id column in the albums table.
