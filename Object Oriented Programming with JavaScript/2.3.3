// Create an object factory that returns objects representing musical 
// instruments. Each instrument should have a name and a type. Users of these 
// objects should be able to play the instrument and show its type. Use the 
// factory function to create three instruments:

// * A cello is a string instrument.
// * A flute is a wind instrument.
// * A drum is a percussion instrument.

let violin = createInstrument('violin', 'string');
violin.play();     // We are playing a tune on this violin
violin.showType(); // This violin is a string instrument

let flute = createInstrument('flute', 'wind');
flute.play();      // We are playing a tune on this flute
flute.showType();  // This flute is a wind instrument

let drum = createInstrument('drum', 'percussion');
drum.play();       // We are playing a tune on this drum
drum.showType();   // This drum is a percussion instrument

// Solution:

function createInstrument(name, type) {
  return {
    name,
    type,

    play() {
      console.log(`We are playing a tune on this ${this.name}.`);
    },

    showType() {
      console.log(`This ${this.name} is a ${this.type} instrument.`);
    },
  };
}
