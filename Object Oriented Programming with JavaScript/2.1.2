// Write a simple constructor function that creates objects that represent 
// books. Each book should have a title, author, and the year published. Create 
// objects that represent the following books:

// | Title	       | Author         | Year Published |
// |---------------|----------------|----------------|
// | Neuromancer	 | William Gibson	| 1984           | 
// | Doomsday Book | Connie Willis	| 1992           | 

// When you are done, identify the type of the objects created, the constructor 
// function, and the instance objects.

function Book(title, author, published) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.published = published;
}

let neuromancer = Book('Neuromancer', 'William Gibson', 1984);
let doomsday = Book('Doomsday Book', 'Connie Willis', 1992);

// Both neuromancer and doomsday of type Book. Book is the constructor 
// function. The instance objects are the objects assigned to neuromancer
// and doomsday.
