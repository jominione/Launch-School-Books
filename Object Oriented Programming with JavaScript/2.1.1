// Create an object that represents a Cessna 152 aircraft. The aircraft should 
// include information that shows its fuel capacity of 24.5 gallons and a 
// cruising speed of 111 knots. The aircraft should be able to take off and 
// land.

// Identify the state and behavior items in this object.

// Solution:

let cessna152 = {
  fuelCapacity: 24.5,
  cruisingSpeed: 111,
  takeOff() {
    console.log("Taking off!");
  },
  land() {
    console.log("Landing!");
  },
};

// The state includes fuelCapacity and cruisingSpeed properties while the
// behaviours are takeOff and land methods.
