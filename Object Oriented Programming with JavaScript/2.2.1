// Consider an application that manages different types of animals, such as 
// dogs, cats, and birds. Each animal can eat, sleep, make sounds, etc., but 
// they each do so in different ways.

// Which of the concepts discussed in this chapter most closely describes 
// the features of the scenario described above?

// Solution:

// The features of the application described above most closely relate to
// the concept of polymorphism. Though each animal is of a different species,
// each has behaviours that are specific to that animal.

// If you said that the application most closely relates to inheritance, 
// consider yourself half right. The key difference here is that each animal
// eats, sleeps, or make sounds in different ways. Thus, the behaviours aren't
// being inherited.
