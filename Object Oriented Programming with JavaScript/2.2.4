// Consider an application that manages a collection of living things, 
// including plants and animals. Plants include trees and flowers, while 
// animals include mammals and birds.

// Which of the concepts discussed in this chapter most closely describes 
// the features of the scenario described above?

// Solution:

// The features of the application described above most closely relate to
// the concept of inheritance. In this application, plants and animals would
// inherit from a type that includes living things, trees and flowers would
// inherit from a plants type, and mammals and birds would inherit from the
// animals. A plant is a living thing, as is an animal. Likewise, trees and
// flowers are plants, while mammals and birds are animals.
