// Write a simple constructor function that creates objects that represent 
// musical albums. Each album should have a title, artist, and release year. 
// Create objects that represent the following 2 albums:

// | Title                     | Artist          | Release Year
// |---------------------------|-----------------|---------------
// | Thriller                  | Michael Jackson | 1982
// | The Dark Side of the Moon | Pink Floyd      | 1973

// When you are done, identify the type of the objects created, the constructor 
// function, and the instance objects.

// Solution:

function Album(title, artist, release) {
  self.title = title;
  self.artist = artist;
  self.release = release;
}

let thriller = Album('Thriller', 'Michael Jackson', 1982);
let dark = Album('The Dark Side of the Moon', 'Pink Floyd', 1973);

// Both thriller and dark are type Album. The constructor function is Album 
// function. The instance objects are the objects assigned to thriller and 
// dark.
