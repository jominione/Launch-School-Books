# Identify the constructors for each of the following methods and classify
# each method as either a "Static" or an "Instance" method:

# * substring
# * create
# * fromCharCode
# * slice
# * toString

# It might be that more than one constructor provides a method with a given
# name. Make sure you list them all in your answer. You can limit your search
# for methods to the String, Object, Array, and Number constructs.

# Hint: Use the documentation at Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and Google
# to determine which constructors provide each method.

# Solution:

# * substring       Constructor: String         Method Type: Instance
# * create          Constructor: Object         Method Type: Static
# * fromCharCode    Constructor: String         Method Type: Static
# * slice           Constructor: Array; String  Method Type: Instance
# * toString        Constructor: Date, Object, Array, Number, String, Boolean
#                                               Method Type: Instance
