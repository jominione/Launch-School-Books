// What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function
// affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);

// Solution: Program will log 1. When foo function is defined it creates a
// function scope. Within the function a variable bar is initialised. This is
// not visible outside of the scope of the function. When log is called it
// assumes the bar on line 1 to output.

// The code logs 1 to the console. foo doesn't affect the value assigned to
// bar on line 1 since JaveaScript functions create an inner scope. Thus,
// bar variable on line 3 is not the same as the one on line 1. In the end,
// foo() has no bearing on the final output.
