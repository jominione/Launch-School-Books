// What value does the following expression evaluate to?

'12' < '9'

// Solution: Evaluates to True. When the operand is a string, the comparison
// operator will perform a character-by-character comparsion. Since the first
// character on left operand is '1' < '9' this evaluates to True.

// The expression evaluates as true since the operands are strings, not 
// numbers. When you compare two strings, JavaScript performs a 
// character-by-character comparison going from left to right, so on the first
// comparison, it determines that '1' < '9', so '12' must be less than '9'.
