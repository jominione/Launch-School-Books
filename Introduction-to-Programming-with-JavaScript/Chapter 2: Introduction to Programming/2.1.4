// Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15.

console.log('5' + 10);

// Solution: Javascript reads statements from left to right and '5' is a string 
// so Javascript assumes the + operator is string concatenation and 
// subsequently induces type coercion on the number 10. 
// The value from string concatenation is then '510'.

// The code logs 510 since every + expression that has a string operand 
// produces a string result no matter what the other operand is. In other 
// words, the Number 10 gets coerced to a String and then gets concatenated
// to the String '5', which produces '510'.
