// Write a function that logs whether an integer is between 0 and 50
// (inclusive), between 51 and 100 (inclusive), greater than 100, or less 
// than 0.

// Solution:

function numberRange(integer) {
  if (integer < 0) {
    console.log(`${integer} is less than 0`)
  } else if (integer <= 50) {
    console.log(`${integer} is between 0 and 50`)
  } else if (integer <= 100) {
    console.log(`${integer} is between 51 and 100`)
  } else {
    console.log(`${integer} is greater than 100`)
  }
}

// Examples:

numberRange(25);
numberRange(75);
numberRange(125);
numberRange(-25);

// Expected Output:

// 25 is between 0 and 50
// 75 is between 51 and 100
// 125 is greater than 100
// -25 is less than 0
