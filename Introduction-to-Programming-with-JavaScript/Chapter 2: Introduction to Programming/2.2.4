// What happens when you run the following code? Why?

const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

// Solution: Lines 4 to 6 will output with NAME = 'Victor'. Line 8 will raise
// an error because NAME was initialised a constant and you can't reassign
// a constant after defining it.
