// What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

{
  let foo = 'bar';
}

console.log(foo);

// Solution: The program outputs an error since foo is out of scope: the let
// statement creates variables with block scope, which limits the visibility
// of the variable to the block. Even though console.log(foo) comes after
// the declaration and initialisation of foo, we still get an error since
// we declared foo inside the block. Outside the block, foo doesn't exist.
