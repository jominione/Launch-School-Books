// Challenging exercise. This exercise has nothing to do with this chapter.
// Instead, it uses concepts you learned earlier in the book. If you can't
// figure out the answer, don't worry: this question can stump developers
// with more experience than you have.

// Earlier, we learned that JavaScript has multiple versions of the numeric
// value zero. In particular it has 0 and -0. While it's mathematically 
// nonsensical to distinguish between 0 and -0, they are distinct values in
// JavaScript. We won't get into why JavaScript has a 0 and -0, but it can
// be useful in some cases.

// There's a problem, however: JavaScript itself doesn't to realise that the
// values are distinct:

// > 0 === -0
// = true

// > String(-0)
// = '0'

// Fortunately, you can use Object.is to determine whether a value is -0:

// > let value = -0;
// > Object.is(value, 0)
// = false

// > Object.is(value, -0)
// = true

// There are other ways to detect a -0 value. Without using Object.is, write
// a function that will return true if the argument is -0, and false if it
// is 0 or any other number.

// What happens if you divide a non-zero integer by zero? Apply this to the 
// problem of determining whether a value is -0.

// Solution:

function isNegativeZero(value) {
  return (1 / value) === -Infinity
}

console.log(isNegativeZero(-0));
console.log(isNegativeZero(0));
console.log(isNegativeZero(132));
