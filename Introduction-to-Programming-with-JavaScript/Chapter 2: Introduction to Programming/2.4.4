// What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');

// Solution: Will not log anything. When scream function is invoked it returns
// nothing. Function ends before console.log is invoked.

// It doesn't log anything. The return on line 3 terminates the function before
// it can log anything.
