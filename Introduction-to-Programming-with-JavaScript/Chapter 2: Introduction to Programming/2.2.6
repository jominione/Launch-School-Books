// Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?

const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);

// Solution: Will not raise error. Constant FOO is initialised on line 3. On
// line 4 starts a block which creates a new scope for let variables. Line 5
// declares a new constant named FOO that shadows the variable from line 3.
// This second constant goes out of scope on line 6 when the block ends. That
// brings FOO from line 3 back into scope so line 6 logs its value: bar.

// For much the same reason as the previous exercise, this program doesn't 
// raise an error, and it logs bar on line 6. One key difference, though,
// is that we are using const instead of let, which may have led you to believe
// an error would occur on line 3. However, since the two const variables are
// separate entitities -- that is, the declaration on line 3 declares a 
// completely new constant -- no error occurs.
