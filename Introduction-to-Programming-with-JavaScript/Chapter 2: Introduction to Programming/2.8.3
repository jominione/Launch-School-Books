// Use object literal syntax (e.g., { key: value, ...} notation) to create
// an object that behaves as an array in a for statement. The object should
// contain at least 3 elements. You should place your code between the braces
// in the let statement.

// Arrays use positive integers starting with 0 as indexes. An array also
// must have a length property.

// let myArray = {
// };

// Solution:

let myArray = {
  0: 'dog',
  1: 'big',
  2: 'cat',
  length: 3,
};

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}
