// What does this code log to the console? Why?

let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = array1;
array1[1] = 4;
console.log(array2);

// Solution: Will log [1, 4, 3]. When array2 was initialised to the value
// of array1 both variables contain [1, 2, 3]. When array1[1] is reassigned
// value 4 it mutates the array referenced by array1 but also changed the
// array referenced by array2.

// When you assign a variable that references an object to another variable. 
// Instead of copying the object, JavaScript only copies the pointer. 

// array1 and array2 are aliases for the same value.

// This result demonstrates that array1 and array2 reference the same array:
// if we change an element using array1, it also changes that element in 
// array2. The opposite is also true: if we change an element in array2, that
// also changes the element in array1.

// This code also demonstrates that assignment of an array to another array
// doesn't create a new array, but instead copies a reference from the original
// array (array1 above) into the target array (array2).
