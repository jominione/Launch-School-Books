// This problem is more challenging than most in this book. Don't worry if
// you can't solve it on your own.

// Write a function similar to the oddLengths function from Exercise 6, but
// don't use map or filter. Instead, try to use the reduce method.

// Use an array as the accumulator. Ideally, you should be able to use the
// return value of reduce as the return value of the function.

// Solution:

function oddLengths(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((accumulator, element) => {
    if (element.length % 2 == 1) {
      return accumulator.concat(element.length);
    }
  return accumulator;
  }, []);
}

// Example:

let arr = ['a', 'abcd', 'abcde', 'abc', 'ab'];
console.log(oddLengths(arr)); // => [1, 5, 3]
