// Identify all of the variables named on each line of the following code.
// You may assume that question is the name of a built-in function in 
// JavaScript (it is not, so this code won't work as written).

// Example:

function multiply(left, right) {
  let product = left * right;
  return product;
}

function getNumber(prompt) {
  return parseFloat(question(prompt));
}

let left = getNumber('Enter the first number: ');
let right = getNumber('Enter the second number: ');
console.log(`${left} * ${right} = ${multiply(left, right)}`);

// Solution: 

// Line 7: multiply, left, right
// Line 8: product, left, right
// Line 9: product
// Line 12: getNumber, prompt
// Line 13: parseFloat, question, prompt
// Line 16: left, getNumber
// Line 17: right, getNumber
// Line 18: left, right, multiply, console (but not log because it is a 
// property name, not a variable name.)

// parseFloat is an actual built-in function in JavaScript; we are pretending
// that question also is a built-in function. As such, we know that both
// parseFloat and question are variable names.

// console is the variable name for the built-in Console object. In contrast,
// console.log is the name of a method in that object. As such, log is a 
// property name, not a variable name.
