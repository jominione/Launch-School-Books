// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = n; i > 1; i = Math.floor(i / 2)) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

// Solution: The time complexity is O(NlogN). The outer loop runs logN as
// it halves i in each iteration. The inner loop runs n times so the overall
// time complexity is O(logN) * O(N) or O(N*logN).

// Space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space.
