// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j *= 2) {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
  }
}

// Solution: The time complexity of the function test is O(NlogN) because it
// involves two nested loops. The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop
// doubles the value of j in each iteration. Thus, the inner loop runs logN
// times. The total number of operations is proportional to N * logN.

// The space complexity is O(1) because it does not use any addtional space.
