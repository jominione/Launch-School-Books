// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = n; i >= 1; i /= 2) {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
}

// Solution: The time complexity if O(logN) because the loop divides the value
// of i by 2 in each iteration. The number of iterations is determined by how
// many times i can be divided by 2 before reaching 1.

// The space complexity of the function test is O(1) because it does not use
// any additional space.
