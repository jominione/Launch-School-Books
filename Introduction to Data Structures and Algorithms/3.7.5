// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result.push(i);
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      result[i] += j;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// Solution: The time complexity of the function test is O(N^2) due to the
// nested loop structure, where both loops run n times. 

// The space complexity of function test is O(N). Note that in the inner loop,
// we are not adding new values to the result array but modifying existing
// values. This is why the space complexity is not O(N^2).
