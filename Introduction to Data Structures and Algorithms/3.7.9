// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  let matrix = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    matrix[i] = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      matrix[i][j] = i + j;
    }
  }
  return matrix;
}

// Solution: Time time complexity of the function test is O(N^2) because it
// involves two nested loops, each running n times. As a result, the number
// of operations is proportional to n * n = n^2.

// The space complexity is O(N^2) because it creates a matrix of size n * n.
// The space requires grows quadratically with the input size.
