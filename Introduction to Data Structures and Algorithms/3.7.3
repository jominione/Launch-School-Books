// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}

// Solution: The time complexity is O(n) while the space complexity is O(n)
// since the result array grows linearly with the input size n.
