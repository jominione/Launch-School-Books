// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        console.log("Hello!");
      }
    }
  }
}

// Solution. The time complexity of the function test is O(N^3) due to the
// nested loops each running n times.

// The space complexity is N(1) because it does not use any additional space
// outside of the input size.
