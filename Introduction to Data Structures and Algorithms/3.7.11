// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
  }
}

// Solution: The time complexity of the function test is O(N) because the
// outer loop runs n times and the inner loop runs a constant 100 times. The
// constant factor does not affect the overall time complexity.

// The space complexity is O(1) because it does not use any additional space.
