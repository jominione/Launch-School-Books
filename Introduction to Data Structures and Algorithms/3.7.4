// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      sum += 1;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

// The time complexity of the function test is O(N^2). The inner loop increases
// iterations witch each iteration of the outer loop until it approaches n,
// so the number of iterations will grow quadratically with n.

// The space complexity is O(1). The sum variable holds an integer value so
// there is no additional space used that grows with n.
