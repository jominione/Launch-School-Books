// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
}

// Solution: The time complexity of the function test is O(N). Although the
// loop runs 2n times, we can simplify the time complexity by removing the
// constant factor. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N).

// Space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space.
