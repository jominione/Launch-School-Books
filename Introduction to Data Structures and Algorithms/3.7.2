// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
  }
}

// Solution: The time complexity of the function test is O(N^2). Although
// the inner loop's number of iterations decreases with each iteration of
// the outer loop, the total number of operation still grows quadratically
// with n.

// The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space proprotional to n is
// used.
