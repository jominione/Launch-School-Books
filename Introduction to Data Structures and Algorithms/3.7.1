// What is the time complexity of the function test? What is its space 
// complexity?

function test(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
}

// Solution: The number of steps required to complete an operation varies
// by size of parameter n. Denoting the integer of n is N then the time 
// complexity of the the function test is O(N).

// Discussion: The time complexity of the function test is O(N) because the
// loop runs n times, where n is the input size. The number of iterations
// directly scales with the input size.

// The space complexity of the function test is O(1) because it does not use
// any additional sapce outside of the input size.
